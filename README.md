# SG-Simulation
Simulation codes for the formation of stress granules comprised of ribosomal subunits. 

The code SGFormationModel_3DDiffusion_240515New.m includes all details of the numerical simulations for the formation of stress granules comprised of ribosomal subunits, including components' interactions and chemical reactions. Part of the code SGFormationModel_3DDiffusion_240515New.m and the code SGFormationModel_3DDiffusion_DataProcess.m are utilized for processing data and plotting figures. The codes find_droplet_3D.m, find_cluster_3D.m and find_neigh_3D.m are demanded funtion codes.
